MSNoise - Documentation
=======================

Originally, MSNoise was a "Python Package for Monitoring Seismic Velocity
Changes using Ambient Seismic Noise". With the release of MSNoise 1.4, and
because of the Plugin Support, we could call MSNoise: "Measuring with Seismic
Noise". The current release version of MSNoise is **MSNoise 1.6**.

The standard MSNoise workflow is designed to go from seismic data archives to
dv/v curves. The monitoring is achieved by computing the cross-correlation of
continuous seismic records for each pair of a network and by studying the
changes in the crosscorrelation function relative to a reference.

The goal of the "suite" is to provide researchers with an efficient processing
tool, while keeping the need for coding to a minimum and avoiding being a black
box. Moreover, as long as the in- and outputs of each step are respected, they
can easily be replaced with one's own codes ! (See :ref:`workflow`).

Plugins can be added and extend the standard workflow from any steps, e.g.
using MSNoise as a cross-correlation toolbox until the `stack` step, and then
branching to the workflow provided by one's plugin.
